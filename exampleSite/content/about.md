This theme was made with Hugo v0.17 on a Mac. It was coded mostly using Textmate and Firefox. It includes a number of features that will help a developer create and manage websites. 

- Responsive design mobile ready
- Custom CSS ability
- Pre defined archetypes
- Markdown

To install this theme you need to download the latest version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) from their website. Follow the instructions to install and configure Hugo for your system. 

One you have Hugo installed run the following in your project directory from the Command Line. 

	$ hugo new site example 

Once this has run, you will have a new hugo site. Congrats. We are not finished yet, though. 

Within your themes directory run the following command. 

	$ git clone https://github.com/hdcdstr8fwd/foundation-theme.git

This will place the theme files within the project theme folder. Have a look at the example config.toml to see how to configure the site.

Thanks again to [Gary](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNUxl0ffgmbC_nK2rSmFTNg) for making the video to scaffold out a basic foundation project, feel free to use and modify this theme as you wish.
